# Task Manager Android App
This is a simple task manager app for Android done as part of my first PRM (Mobile Applications Development) course at PJATK university. It uses the default androidx.*, kotlinx.* and com.google.android.* libraries along with SQLite database.

## Features
- ability to add, edit and remove various tasks to be performed by the user (like shopping, making your bed, washing your cat, etc.)
- each task has a priority, deadline date, image and progress circle adjustable within the app
- summary for each task can be sent via e-mail, SMS, etc.
- tasks are being sorted by their deadline dates
